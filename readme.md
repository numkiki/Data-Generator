## Introduction
This is Project 1 - A Mock (Student) Data Generator. The project aims to randomly generate some basic information of a Student: 
* ID
* Name
* GPA
* Address
* Telephone number
* Date of Birth
* Email

## About me:
**Name:** Phan Xu√¢n Nam
**ID:** 20127247
**What I have done:** everything you asked in this project
1. Read Students' information to the vector
1. Generate a random number, equivalent to the number of randomly generated Students
2. Generate every information randomly
3. push_back() the generated information to the vector
4. Print out the Students' GPA, ID, Name whose GPAs are higher than the average GPA in the vector

**What I haven't done:** check if any information of a student is identical or not. Also I haven't included the ability to stop the push_back() if one piece of information doesn't match the regex.

**Expected grade:** 10

**DEMO link:** *https://youtu.be/rurM2wo9DcI* (please subscribe me if you can I'd love a subscribe from my teacher haha) .

**Bonus point:** I have written the regex to check for the validity of the information in the "students.txt". Therefore, if, for instance, the ID doesn't match with the regex, it will not push back to the vector. 

**Notice 1:** Since I hard-code by myself (still similar to the format you give as an example), the regex will only work if you hard-code exactly the format I did in the "students.txt".

**Notice 2:** If possible, could you give the feedback in the comment section below the video? It will help me a lot.
